                        Section II of this Policy applies only to Subscribers. If you are a Subscriber, the “Customer Agreement” governs the collection and processing of information collected from you through the Customer’s instance of the Service (e.g. a Customer's organization or workspace, but for purposes of this Policy referred to as the “Workspace”), including all associated messages, attachments, files, tasks, projects and project names, team names, channels, conversations, and other content submitted through the Service (“Workspace Content”). In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Customer Agreement, the Customer Agreement governs. Because the Customer controls the Workspace used by Subscribers, if you have any questions about the Customer’s specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you are a Subscriber located in the European Union, please note that the Customer is the data controller with respect to the processing of your Workspace Content pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). When processing Workspace Content of EU data subjects governed by the Customer Agreement, ThinkWyse is the data processor, meaning that we collect and process such information solely on behalf of the Customer.

                                Workspace Content. Workspace Content is collected, used, and shared by ThinkWyse in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, or as required by applicable law. The Customer, and not ThinkWyse, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Workspace Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Customer may provide or remove access to the Service, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, or share projects. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings that they have instituted with respect the Workspace Content that you provide when using the Service.

You will then have the ability to provide optional profile information, such as a photograph or basic demographic data. With your permission, we may also upload calendar information stored on your mobile device to your account. If you submit payment information in connection with your use of the Service, we utilize a third party credit card payment processing company to collect payment information, including your credit card number, billing address, and phone number. In such circumstances, the third party service provider, and not ThinkWyse, stores your payment information on our behalf.

A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Websites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer and login session; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand which pages of the Websites you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of the Websites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).
