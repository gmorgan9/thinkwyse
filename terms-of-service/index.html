                        As an Authorized User, you gain access to the Service through a Customer of ThinkWyse. For example, if you are joining your employer’s organization, Customer is your employer. If you are joining a workspace created by your friend using a personal email address, your friend is the ThinkWyse Customer and is authorizing you to join his or her workspace. The Customer Agreement governs our relationship and commitment to deliver the Service to Customer, who may then invite Authorized Users to join their ThinkWyse. When you or another Authorized User submits content or information to the Service, such as messages or files (“<span class="policy-bold">Customer Data</span>”), you acknowledge and agree that, as between ThinkWyse and Customer, the Customer Data is controlled by Customer and the Customer Agreement provides Customer with choices and control over that Customer Data. For example, Customer may manage permissions, enable or disable third party integrations, or take steps to expand, consolidate or share the contents of ThinkWyse portfolios, projects, tasks and subtasks, and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data.
